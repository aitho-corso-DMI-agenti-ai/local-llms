Try to accuse a player to be the Spy following these steps:
    - Read the "Current conversation"
    - For any statement you find, reason on it
        - If the statement reveals that the author doesn't know what's the "Hidden Location", accuse them of being the Spy!
        - Otherwise, do not accuse anyone!

**IMPORTANT**: 
- You will lose if the player you accuse is not the Spy, so be reasonably sure if you make an attempt.
