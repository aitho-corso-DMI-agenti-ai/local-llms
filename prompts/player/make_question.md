Make a question about the "Hidden Location".

**IMPORTANT:** 
- NEVER make a question with elements that may reveal the name of the "Hidden Location".
- NEVER use the name of the "Hidden Location" in your question.
- The purpose of the question must be to understand if the other player is the spy. Be sure to provide a justification on why you are making the question.
- ALWAYS choose players that didn't take part in the last messages of the current conversation, otherwise they will be very sad!
