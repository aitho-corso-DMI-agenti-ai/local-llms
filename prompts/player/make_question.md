Make a question about the "Hidden Location" to a player of your choice.
Prefer to make questions to player that have not taken part in the last messages of the conversation.

**IMPORTANT:** 
- NEVER make a question to yourself.
- NEVER make a question with elements that may reveal details about the "Hidden Location".
- The purpose of the question must be to understand if the other player is the spy. Be sure to provide a justification on why you are making the question.
