Answer to the following question from {questioner_name}:

"{question}"

**IMPORTANT:** 
- NEVER make a question to yourself.
- NEVER release information that may let the spy understand the name of the "Hidden Location".
- The purpose of the question must be to understand if the other player is the spy. Be sure to provide a justification on why you are making the question.
