Attempt to guess what's the "Secret Location" following these steps:
    - Read the "Current conversation"
    - Read the list of possible "Secret Locations".
    - Check if there is any detail that indicates one of the possible "Secret Locations"
        - If you have enough elements to make a guess, then reply with your guessed location
        - Otherwise, reply with "null" if you want to wait for the conversation to continue and gather more information.

**IMPORTANT**: 
- You will lose if your guess is wrong. Be sure to be convinced if you attempt to guess the location.
- You must justify your choice of guessing or not guessing based on the content of the current conversation.
