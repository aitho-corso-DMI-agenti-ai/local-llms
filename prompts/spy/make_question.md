Make a question about the Hidden Location to a player of your choice.

**IMPORTANT:** 
- NEVER make a question to yourself.
- The purpose of the question must be to get information about the "Hidden Location". 
    - Be discrete, do not let other players understand that you do not know what's the "Hidden Location".
- Be sure to provide a justification on why you are making the question.
